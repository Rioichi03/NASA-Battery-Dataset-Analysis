Objective:
The primary goal of this analysis was to visualize and understand the changes in key battery parameters (Electrolyte Resistance, Charge Transfer Resistance, and Total Battery Impedance) over time as the battery aged through charge/discharge cycles. The focus was on identifying trends that align with expected battery degradation behavior.

Insights:

Electrolyte Resistance (Re) vs Time:

The scatter plot for Re shows a steady upward trend over time.

This indicates an increase in electrolyte resistance, a natural outcome of battery aging due to chemical changes in the electrolyte.

Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) vs Time:

The scatter plot for Rct also exhibits a gradual increase.

This behavior is consistent with electrode surface degradation and the growth of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer, which impedes charge transfer.

Battery Impedance (Re + Rct) vs Time:

The combined Battery Impedance plot demonstrates a smooth upward trend over time.

This metric effectively captures the overall degradation of the battery as both Re and Rct increase.

Conclusion:

Consistent Degradation Trends:

The gradual increase in Re, Rct, and Battery Impedance reflects the expected behavior of lithium-ion batteries undergoing aging. These trends validate the reliability of the dataset and analysis.

Key Metrics for Health Monitoring:

Battery Impedance serves as a comprehensive indicator of overall health, while Re and Rct provide deeper insights into specific degradation mechanisms.

Data Alignment with Theory:

The results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating the gradual loss of efficiency in the electrolyte and electrodes with repeated charge/discharge cycles.

Recommendations:

Real-World Applications:

This analysis can be used to design predictive models for battery lifespan and optimize maintenance schedules for lithium-ion batteries.

Further Research:

Expanding the dataset to include more cycle counts and diverse operating conditions could enhance the robustness of these insights.
